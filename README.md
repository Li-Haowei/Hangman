This is an Android hangman game, but it is not just a hangman game.

There are libraries for words to be randomly generated from, such as GRE vocabulary, SAT vocabulary(incoming), Gmat vocabulary(incoming), and ect.
Each game user will be given 2 characters as hints(more options for hints to come), and user is allowed to make 5 mistakes before loss
(In other words, if the user gets a word length of 6, he automatically win, which needs to be debugged)

There is also an option for user to look at the definition of the word before guessing
